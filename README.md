CONSUS – Off-chain zk Execution Layer for Solana
=================================================

CONSUS is a modular execution layer designed to scale Solana by offloading computationally intensive logic off-chain. Using zero-knowledge proofs, CONSUS preserves on-chain trust while shifting workloads away from the base layer—reducing congestion and increasing throughput without compromising security.

Core Concept
------------

CONSUS executes logic off-chain, generates cryptographic zk-proofs, and submits them to an on-chain verifier contract. This allows for efficient computation without re-execution on Solana, maintaining trustless validation.

System Architecture
-------------------

- zkVM Core: Executes WASM guest programs and generates verifiable proof transcripts  
- Verifier Contract (Anchor): Validates zk proofs on Solana without re-running logic  
- Host/Guest Runtimes: WASI-compatible environments to handle modular execution flows  
- Executor: Custom off-chain orchestrator that manages runtime state and proof flow  
- Orchestrator (in development): REST-based controller powered by LLMs for dynamic coordination, fault recovery, and adaptive logic routing  
- Frontend Dashboard: React-based UI for real-time execution monitoring and debugging

Monorepo Layout

/zkvm → Core zk virtual machine
/guest → WASM-based guest logic
/host → Host runtime and interface
/executor → Off-chain executor logic
/verifier-contract → Solana smart contract (Anchor)
/frontend-dashboard → Live execution dashboard (React)
/docs → Technical documentation
/consus_full_stack → Composable stack with orchestration


Development Status
------------------

- Proof circuits and smart contracts are fully operational in local environments  
- zkVM proof outputs are verifiable on-chain via the verifier contract  
- AI-based orchestration is in active development, targeting automated fault handling and coordination
