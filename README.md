# Consus

Consus is a pseudo-layer execution buffer for Solana. It reduces congestion by offloading high-frequency transactions, running logic off-chain with zero-knowledge proof validation before submitting verified results to Solana mainnet.

## Components

- zkVM Layer (Risc0/SP1)
- Executor Layer (Rust): Parallel execution engine
- Verifier Contract (Anchor): Validates ZK-proofs
- AI Swarm Layer (LangChain): Filters spam, ranks priority
- Frontend Dashboard (React): Observes system state

## Use Cases

- Bots executing in parallel without spamming L1
- Prediction markets with fast batch resolution
- Token trading, simulation, and memecoin platforms
- Any system needing secure parallelism with Solana finality

## Status

Development in progress. Third-party audit planned.
